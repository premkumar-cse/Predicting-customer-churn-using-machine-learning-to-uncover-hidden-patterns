Overview

Customer churn represents the loss of clients or subscribers, which directly impacts business growth. This project applies data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning algorithms to predict churn with high accuracy. By uncovering patterns and correlations in the data, we provide actionable insights to mitigate churn risk.

Features

Cleaned and preprocessed customer data

Exploratory Data Analysis with visualizations

Machine learning models for prediction (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Feature importance analysis


Dataset

The dataset contains historical customer information such as:

Demographics (age, gender, etc.)

Services subscribed

Tenure

Payment methods

Churn label (Yes/No)


Note: The dataset used can be replaced with a relevant company-specific or open-source dataset.

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook

How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Predicting-Customer-Churn.git


2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the main script or Jupyter notebook:

python churn_prediction.py



Results

The models demonstrated high accuracy in predicting churn, with the best model achieving an F1-score of over X%. Feature importance highlighted key drivers such as contract type, monthly charges, and tenure.

Conclusion

This project shows that machine learning can effectively predict customer churn by analyzing customer behavior data. Organizations can utilize these insights to take preventive actions and enhance customer loyalty.

Future Work

Integration with real-time customer data

Deployment as a web app or API

Use of deep learning models for more complex patterns
